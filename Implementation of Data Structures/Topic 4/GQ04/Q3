Choose the correct options out of the following:


Lists can be used to represent 1000 digit numbers

Binary search cannot be done in O(log n) time on sorted lists

Lists can be used to model large numbers. Each node of the list can be used to store a digit and the entire list can represent one single number.

To perform binary search, we need to be able to access the elements of the list directly, i.e. in O(1) time which is not possible as we do not have a direct reference to each list element.

A list can model a stack if the elements are added to one end and removed from the same end. A queue can be represented by a list if elements are added to one end and removed from the other end.

Traversing a list takes more time as the elements are not sequential. So to reach the next element, some pointer operations need to be performed. While in a vector, the next memory location contains the next value which can be accessed much faster.
